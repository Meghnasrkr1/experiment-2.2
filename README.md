Java Programs: Autoboxing, Serialization & File Handling
Overview
This project demonstrates autoboxing/unboxing, serialization, and file handling in Java for efficient data processing and management.

Part A: Sum of Integers
Accepts integer inputs as strings.

Converts to Integer (autoboxing) and sums them (unboxing).

Demonstrates Integer.parseInt() for string parsing.

Part B: Student Serialization
Student class implements Serializable.

Saves object to file (serialization) and retrieves it (deserialization).

Confirms persistence by displaying student details.

Part C: Employee Management System
Menu-driven program: Add Employee, Display Employees, Exit.

Employee data stored in a file using object streams.

Demonstrates file I/O and persistent storage.

Technologies Used
Java SE, Collections, File I/O, Serialization
